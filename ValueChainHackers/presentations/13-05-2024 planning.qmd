2. **Functionality Development**:
    - Progress in developing the supply chain mapping feature.
    - Enabled system to guess nodes using first-order logic and automate the search process.

3. **AI Segmentation**:
    - Divided process into three distinct AI components:
        - AI for searching information.
        - AI for making connections and data mashing.
        - AI for creating displays, widgets, and tables.

4. **Feature Requests Addressed**:
    - Noted and planned important feature requests like the accuracy counter for supply chain mapping.

5. **Initial MVP**:
    - Demonstrated an initial version of a minimally viable product (MVP).

#### What Could Be Improved

1. **Accuracy and Quality Assurance**:
    - Ensure the system's accuracy and address concerns about missing small, vital components.
    - Requested a feature to improve accuracy.

2. **Focus and Scope Management**:
    - Avoid getting into "rabbit holes".
    - Focus on achieving a functional product that provides reasonably accurate mappings.

3. **Balancing Development Efforts**:
    - Balance efforts between creating a usable product and maintaining high accuracy.

## Work done
