## Introduction

Deploying AI models for supply chain mapping requires robust hardware and software configurations. Given a budget of 10,000 euros, this analysis provides multiple server setup options, balancing cost and performance to ensure efficient AI model deployment and operation.

## Hardware Options

### Option 1: High-Performance Configuration

**Components:**
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (16 cores, 32 threads) - €700
- **GPU:** 2 x NVIDIA RTX 3080 - €2,000
- **Memory:** 128GB DDR4 RAM - €600
- **Storage:** 2TB NVMe SSD - €300
- **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Hero - €400
- **Power Supply:** Corsair RM850x 850W - €150
- **Cooling:** Noctua NH-D15 - €100
- **Case:** Fractal Design Meshify C - €100
- **Networking:** Gigabit Ethernet Card - €50
- **UPS:** APC Back-UPS Pro - €200

**Total Cost:** €4,600

**Analysis:**
This configuration provides a balanced and powerful setup, ideal for handling intensive AI computations required for supply chain mapping. The dual RTX 3080 GPUs offer significant parallel processing power, ensuring efficient model training and inference.

### Option 2: Budget-Friendly Configuration

**Components:**
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X (8 cores, 16 threads) - €400
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3070 - €800
- **Memory:** 64GB DDR4 RAM - €300
- **Storage:** 1TB NVMe SSD - €150
- **Motherboard:** MSI B550-A PRO - €150
- **Power Supply:** EVGA 750W - €100
- **Cooling:** Cooler Master Hyper 212 - €50
- **Case:** NZXT H510 - €80
- **Networking:** Gigabit Ethernet Card - €50
- **UPS:** APC Back-UPS Pro - €200

**Total Cost:** €2,280

**Analysis:**
This budget-friendly configuration is suitable for smaller AI models or less intensive workloads. While it offers less computational power compared to the high-performance option, it still provides a solid foundation for running AI models efficiently.

## Software Requirements

1. **Operating System:** Ubuntu Server (Free)
2. **AI Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers (Free)
3. **Model Management:** NVIDIA NGC or Ollama (Free or subscription-based services)

## Conclusion

Selecting the right server setup depends on the specific needs and scale of your AI models. The high-performance configuration is recommended for extensive and intensive AI workloads, providing robust performance and scalability. The budget-friendly option is suitable for smaller-scale operations, offering a cost-effective solution without compromising too much on performance.

### Further Considerations

- **Future Upgrades:** Both configurations allow for future upgrades, such as adding more GPUs or increasing RAM, to accommodate growing computational needs.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Consider the power consumption of the components, especially if operating in an environment with limited cooling capabilities.
