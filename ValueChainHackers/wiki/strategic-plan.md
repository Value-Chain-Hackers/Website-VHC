# Strategic Plan

## Core Objectives

**Strengthening Collaboration for Systemic Impact:** Building a dynamic network of partnerships across academic, industry, governmental, and non-governmental sectors to amplify the adoption of upcycling practices and influence systemic change.

**Pioneering Upcycling Supply Chain Solutions:** Innovating at the intersection of sustainability and profitability, developing research-driven insights and practices that optimize supply chain operations without compromising ethical standards or financial outcomes.

**Empowering Through Education:** Creating a comprehensive educational ecosystem that leverages workshops, simulations, and digital resources to equip current and future professionals with the skills and knowledge necessary for implementing upcycling supply chain practices.

## Creating Impact

**What do we create? What do we change?** At VCR, we are hardwired to create “extra value” for supply chains; this is a combination of real demonstrable improvements in efficiency, marked by reduced operational costs and increased throughput and new upcycling opportunities.

**Living Projects:** VCR is not a commercial enterprise and as such conducts research based on public opinion with visibility as a key marker. Projects “evolve” to better themselves over time; measuring impact in supply chains can take a long time after all.

### How do we select what to Change?

We need a rigorous stakeholder analysis to identify who must gain or lose or could be affected by a particular supply chain. This helps us understand the 'power' of stakeholders to change the system. We then use the align method to ensure stakeholders are aligned and the stakes are clear before the project enters the lab phase. This analysis is more comprehensive than typical projects as we consider the additional value for the total ecosystem.

Our unique searching methods like Reverse OSI and automatic searching help us find additional 'signals' of unsustainable supply chains, using forensics and digital penetration methodologies. Timing is crucial. We use agile – scrum methodology to ensure flexibility and timely adjustments. Each project iteration acts as a checkpoint to reassess and realign our strategies.

Scoping is equally important. The align procedure ensures that the output of our efforts has real value, and all stakeholders have a clear stake. We also need to find alternative ways to identify stakeholders or involved parties who might not be obvious. This includes active national monitoring, data mining, social engineering, and competitive intelligence gathering.

### Monitoring

We can use information and advanced algorithms to find supply chains as targets, such as taking a Composite Sustainability Score. This score is calculated by weighting and summing the normalized scores of the three components: EIscore, SRscore, and GQscore. Combining this with an LMM process allows us to create an 'AI research agent' to find specific target supply chains and establish a baseline. The combination of LMM processes and algorithms lets us steer the AI by adjusting the weights of different values.

### Hardware Requirements

- RAM: 64GB+
- Storage: 2TB SSD

### Software and Libraries

- Python: Version 3.8+
- PyTorch: Version 1.8.1+

### Open Source Research

We can use forensic methods to identify specific stakeholders. By using selection criteria, we can scan the internet for activists, corporations, or institutions. Using the EDRM model developed by the University of Amsterdam, we can set up a process to help identify actors in systems that might not want to be found.

- Tableau Public: For data visualization (there's a free version available).
- Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting the OSI process analysis and findings in a shareable and reproducible format.

### REVERSE OSI – New development

A new idea is to reverse the OSI process. Instead of looking for specific actors through signals, we look at the end result and try to find the actor behind it. By analyzing the law's requirements, such as due diligence on human rights and environmental impacts, we can pinpoint sectors and SMEs with extensive supply chains in high-risk areas.

### Stakeholder Analysis

We need to perform a mutual benefits analysis and develop an engagement plan for each potential partner. Networking events, hackathons, and social media 'phishing' can help us identify and engage stakeholders. Reverse OSI – THESIS involves using theses and research to identify individuals or organizations researching alternative solutions.

### Practical Outcomes

We focus on evolving supply chains with measurable improvements. Evolution opportunities are projects or learnings that bring together supply chains and companies, grants, or new upcoming laws. We should aim for a 20% increase in adoption rates among targeted industries by 2028 through producing and disseminating at least 10 detailed case studies and reports that highlight the economic benefits of upcycling practices within supply chains.

Our education goal is to educate 2500 individuals by 2028, creating a community that actively supports sustainable practices. By establishing and nurturing collaborative networks, we aim to form a community with transparent mutual benefits for each member.
