# Mission Statement and Objectives

## VISION
Creating more Conscious Supply chains

## Mission
"Evolutionize global supply chain dynamics by adding extra value in upcycling and good practices ensuring that every link in the chain not only benefits economically but also contributes positively to the environment and society.

Revolutionizing global value chains working together with local communities and stakeholders to identify challenges and systemic dilemmas and to conscientiously develop positive and socioeconomical and environmentally beneficial change.

## Foster Collaborative Networks
VCR will combine the strengths and resources of various stakeholders enabling more effective and innovative solutions to sustainability challenges. This collective approach accelerates systemic change making it a critical strategy for achieving lasting environmental and social impacts. By working together organizations can pool their efforts to create solutions that are not only more sustainable but also economically viable ensuring that the drive towards sustainability is a shared journey not a solitary endeavor.

**Action Step**: Establish and nurture collaborative networks that create a symbiotic ecosystem benefiting all stakeholders involved.

**Goal**: Form a community or network with transparent mutual benefits for each member. This means that we need to publish more create active polling and make sure that all our research is open.

## Educate and Empower
By reshaping our understanding and attitudes towards sustainability it not only prepares us to innovate within the supply chain but also to act as catalysts for broader societal change. This approach is not just about solving current problems but about preventing future ones by embedding sustainable thinking at the core of our decision-making processes. In essence it's about securing a livable planet for future generations while ensuring equitable access to resources today. Without this shift in mindset efforts to address environmental and social challenges may remain superficial and short-lived underscoring the critical nature of education and empowerment in achieving lasting change.

**Action Steps**:
- Engage in deep knowledge exploration and innovative learning methods with students educators and volunteers.
- Aim for systemic dependencies by implementing the Patreon system and new agile learning methodologies.

**Goal**: Build a self-sustaining educational organization focused on sustainability.

**KPI**: Educate 2500 individuals by 2028 creating a community that actively supports sustainable practices.

## Drive Economic Viability
To drive economic viability through upcycling supply chains is rooted in the need to demonstrate their comprehensive benefitsâ€”not only in terms of social and environmental impact but also from an economic perspective. By evidencing that sustainable practices like upcycling are not merely ethical choices but also financially beneficial businesses are more likely to adopt these practices.

**Action Steps**:
- Prove the social environmental and economic benefits of upcycling supply chains to businesses.
- Show trough simulation and data gathering why sustainability matters.
- Encourage businesses to adopt upcycling solutions by demonstrating their necessity and economic advantage.

**Goal**: Produce and disseminate at least 10 detailed case studies and reports that highlight the economic benefits of upcycling practices within supply chains aiming for a 20% increase in adoption rates among targeted industries by 2028.

Create chains from mere transactional pathways to transformative forces for global well-being.
