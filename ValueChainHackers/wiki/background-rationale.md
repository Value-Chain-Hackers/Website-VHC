# Background and Rationale

## Growth Trajectory in the European Market
The European supply chain management software market is poised for significant growth with projections indicating a 5.26% increase from 2024 to 2028, culminating in a market value of US$5.61 billion. This trend underscores a growing dependency on digital solutions to bolster supply chain efficiency and resilience, highlighting the fertile ground for VCR's innovative approaches.

## Challenges in Current Logistics and Supply Chain Dynamics
The landscape of logistics has been marred by unprecedented disruptions, notably in 2020 with a record 27.8% of organizations experiencing over 20 disruptions, a sharp rise from 4.8% in 2019. These disruptions, exacerbated by the pandemic, Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the decline of the Chinese manufacturing dominance, underscore the urgent need for robust, resilient supply chain solutions. The escalating costs of raw materials, identified by 71% of global companies as a primary threat, alongside the critical demand for rapid delivery, further stress the necessity for innovative, accountable procurement strategies.

## Technological Adoption and Cybersecurity Concerns
The adoption of technology in managing supply chain disruptions has seen a significant uptick, with over half of the organizations leveraging technology for disruption analysis and supply chain mapping. This digital shift, however, brings its own set of challenges, notably cybersecurity risks, which have surged during the COVID-19 era, affecting 81% of global organizations. The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks highlight a critical operational challenge for supply chain management, emphasizing the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.

## The Imperative for Sustainability and Efficiency
The drive towards sustainability is becoming increasingly pronounced, with 82% of companies willing to invest more for zero-carbon shipping options. This shift not only reflects a growing consumer demand for sustainable practices but also aligns with the potential for cost savings and competitive advantage, further supported by governmental and EU regulatory focuses on sustainable logistics.

## VCR's Strategic Positioning in the Netherlands
The Netherlands, with its strategic location and advanced logistics infrastructure, presents an ideal setting for VCR. The country's logistics sector is expected to grow substantially, offering VCR a prime opportunity to capitalize on its innovative supply chain and logistics solutions. This positioning is bolstered by the broader European market's openness to digital transformation and sustainable practices, aligning perfectly with VCR's mission and capabilities.
